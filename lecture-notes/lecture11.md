# Lecture 11

### Previous class check-up
- We studied how inference is done via maximum likelihood
- We studied two software options: raxml and iq-tree

### Learning objectives

At the end of today's session, you will be able to
- assess the strenghts and weaknesses of every approach: distances, parsimony, likelihood
- identify the scenarios where each method outperforms the others

### Pre-class work

- Review our class material on distances, parsimony and likelihood
- Investigate further in phylogenetic literature about the strengths and weaknesses of the method of your team

### In-class dynamic

**Instructions:**

- 15 minutes breakout session: each team will prepare a 5-minute presentation with their argument on why their method is the best (focusing on the pros of their method and the cons of the other methods)
- Debate part 1: Each team gives their 5-minute arguments to the whole class and they take notes of what other teams criticize of their method (15 minutes total)
- 10 minutes breakout session: each team prepares a 5-minute rebuttal to what other teams criticized about their method
- Debate part 2: Each team presents their 5-minute rebuttal to what other teams criticized about their method (15 minutes total)
- Zoom poll: Which team gave the most convincing arguments?
- Rest of the class (15 minutes): we summarize the pros and cons of each method and reach conclusions on when each method can outperform others
